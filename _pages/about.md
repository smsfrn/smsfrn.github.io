I am a PhD candidate in the [Blair Lab](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/blairlab/home) at the University of Minnesota studying how species respond to ecosystem change and restoration. My current projects leverage quantitative models, historical sources, and citizen-science data to understand the responses of animals (mostly birds) to urban greening in cities and grassland restoration in agricultural landscapes. Before returning to school, I was an environmental scientist at the [San Francisco Estuary Institute](https://sfei.org), where I developed tools to support landscape-scale restoration, climate-change adaptation, and ecological resilience in human-dominated ecosystems.
