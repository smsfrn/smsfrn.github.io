I am a PhD candidate in the [Blair Lab](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/blairlab/home) at the University of Minnesota studying how species respond to ecosystem change and restoration. My current projects leverage quantitative models, historical sources, and citizen science data to understand the responses of animals (mostly birds) to urban greening in cities and grassland restoration in agricultural landscapes. Before returning to school, I was an environmental scientist at the [San Francisco Estuary Institute](https://sfei.org), where I developed tools to support landscape-scale restoration, climate-change adaptation, and ecological resilience in human-dominated ecosystems.
