## Quantifying functional changes in ecosystems at landscape scales

Land-use change is the largest current driver of global biodiversity loss. Understanding how land-use change alters key ecosystem functions is important for clarifying the mechanisms by which land-use change actually affects species. My work in the California Delta translates maps of land-cover into quantitative estimates of changes in net primary production (the generation of organic carbon that fuels much of life on Earth). The work has shown that the amount of amount of organic carbon available to aquatic foodwebs in the Delta has declined by ~95% since European colonization and helped predict how climate change and possible restoration actions are likely to affect primary production in the future. In this way, the work is advancing our ability to  incorporate metrics of ecosystem function into land use and conservation planning efforts.
